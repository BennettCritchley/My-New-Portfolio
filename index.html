            <h2>Hey! Welcome to my portfolio.</h2>
            <p>
              Hello, I'm Bennett and this is my portfolio. I am a full-time
              student at Bloc coding school, from Fort McMurray, Alberta. I’m
              learning JS, HTML, and now CSS. When I was young I always wanted
              to be a coder as I thought they could do anything and slowly I’m
              learning that they can do just about that.
            </p>

            <p>
              With web development, I believe I could make an impact on the
              industry and that makes me strive to keep being better at it. I
              have always worked better as part of a group so I cant wait to
              work alongside colleagues and collaborate to make future projects
              even better. Once I've finished school I want to be able to
              provide people with full websites tailored just to their liking
              with any web language they would want.

            <h2>About Me.</h2>
            <p>
              Want to know more about me? You came to the perfect place! Before
              moving to Fort McMurray, Alberta, I lived in Barrie, Ontario,
              Canada. I spent most of my childhood there and really got my first
              touch with computers and tech and instantly fell in love.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once I graduated highschool I didn't quite know what I wanted to
              do so I took a 2-year break and worked as a carpenter's assistant.
              In those 2 years, I got deep into gaming and streaming and started
              messing around with the code of Minecraft and had a lot of fun
              with it so I decided to get into coding so that my job could be
              something I've always enjoyed.
